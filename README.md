ansi-canvas
===========
### Render a &lt;canvas&gt; node to your terminal

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16198591/clock.gif)

This module provides a `<canvas>` object backed by [node-canvas][], with its
`width` and `height` properties automatically set to the proper size of the
terminal window.

The result is that you can use the [HTML Canvas API][canvas api] to render
directly to your terminal.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install ansi-canvas
```


Example
-------

``` js
var ac = require('ansi-canvas');

var canvas = ac();
var context = canvas.getContext('2d');

// draw a purple background
context.fillStyle = 'purple';
context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

// write some text
context.fillStyle    = '#00f';
context.font         = 'italic 15px sans-serif';
context.textBaseline = 'top';
context.fillText  ('Hello world!', 1, 1);
context.font         = 'bold 20px sans-serif';
context.strokeText('Hello world!', 1, 21);

// IMPORTANT!!!
// call `canvas.render()` when you're ready to flush the canvas to the terminal
canvas.render();
```

Outputs something like:

Set the Font Size Really Small!
-------------------------------

And then you get really high resolution, and then you could do something crazy…
like… render SNES directly in your Terminal!!!

_(note: this is just an image. if you were to actually implement SNES in the
Terminal at a reasonable framerate and resolution you'd be god-like, but please
let me know if you do it!)_
